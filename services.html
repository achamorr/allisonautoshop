                                            Allison Auto Center wants to make sure that all four of your vehicle’s tires receive the proper maintenance and care to prolong tire life and prevent tire wear.
                                            Our tire rotation and balance services will keep your car driving safely and smoothly as well as extend tire life – reducing the need and frequency of having to get brand new tires.
                                            Driving down uneven roads, hitting bumps and holes that you couldn’t see or avoid, long commutes, and even just turning left and right over the miles can cause an imbalance in your tires which will cause uneven wear.
                                            Balancing and rotating your tires is an inexpensive way to reduce vibrations and tire wear while creating a steadier and safer ride.
                                            Allison Auto Center recommends rotating your tires every 3,000 – 6,000 miles and balancing your tires every 12,000 – 15,000 miles depending on your vehicle’s weight, driving conditions, and tire quality.
                                            Rotating and aligning your tires helps ensure they are getting even wear while balancing tires helps redistribute the mass of the tire and wheel to which it is attached.
                                            We will make suggestions regarding your current tires’ state and inform you of any serious issues that we may have encountered when inspecting your tires.
                                            Contact Allison Auto Center to schedule a tire rotation and balance appointment today.

                                            At Allison Auto Center, we know how brutal the summers can be and how frosty the winters can get in New York. 
                                            That’s why we recommend having your auto A/C system checked once a year, or at the first sign of complication, in order to catch minor problems before they cost you more time and money.
                                            Occasionally, malfunctions in your car’s air conditioning system can be severe, thus making driving conditions uncomfortable.
                                            We take care of any issues that may be a result of malfunctioning temperatures inside your vehicle.
                                            Issues with your A/C are some of the most common maintenance needs you’ll encounter while owning a vehicle. 
                                            These types of repairs can range from a small leak to a compressor failure.
                                            Whereas some A/C repairs are minor and can be solved with simple solutions, such as just adding freon, Allison Auto Center's premium service means that we appropriately diagnose your vehicle’s A/C repair needs the first time, ensuring there is no price deviation from what is quoted.
                                            At Allison Auto Center we also recommend having your heating system checked once a year, or at the first sign of complication, so if you do have a minor problem, we can catch it before it costs you an unnecessary amount of time and money.
                                            Our technicians have years of training and experience, engage in continuing education, and work with the latest, advanced equipment.

                                            Preventative car maintenance helps prolong the life of your vehicle. 
                                            We love having you visit Allison Auto Center, but we know you would rather have a reliable, working vehicle. 
                                            Regular preventative car maintenance, in the long run, can reduce your visits to the auto mechanic and save you money.
                                            Every manufacturer sets official maintenance guidelines for each vehicle type. 
                                            You can check your owner’s manual to find out the recommended car maintenance schedule for your car or truck, but in general, you can follow the rules below to stay on top of your car’s health.
                                            <b>Oil Change: Every 3,000 – 5,000 Miles </b> 
                                            The simplest and most effective way for you to keep your car maintained is through regular oil changes. 
                                            Oil travels through just about every part of your engine and keeps it running smoothly, so its importance can’t be underestimated.
                                            <b>Fluid Levels Check: Every 3,000 – 5,000 Miles</b>
                                            When you bring your vehicle into Allison Auto Center, we can check your car or truck for the right fluid levels. 
                                            Antifreeze, power steering, coolant, even wiper fluid—we check to make sure these are all maintaining proper levels so your vehicle’s parts have the juice they need to keep going.
                                            Plus, frequent checks can help you determine if you have a leak somewhere in the engine.
                                            <b>Filter Replacement: Every 10,000 – 15,000 Miles</b>
                                            Filters like your cabin air filter and engine filter are easy to replace and will keep dirt and other contaminants from building up inside your engine. 
                                            Not only that, but changing your air filter helps keep pollutants and allergens out of your vehicles interior.
                                            <b>Tire Rotation every 5,000 and Tire Balance: Every 10,000 Miles</b>
                                            Rotating your tires makes them last longer because they wear more evenly when rotated. 
                                            It also makes driving safer, especially over long distances where tire wear can be a problem.
                                            <b>Battery Check: Every Year</b>
                                            In addition to fluid levels, we’ll also check your battery and clean the terminals if necessary. 
                                            Most batteries can go a while without any maintenance but it’s important to recognize if buildup is occurring or if the battery is nearing the end of its lifespan.
                                             Most batteries in our climate will only last 3 years.
                                            Factory Scheduled Maintenance/Inspections: Every 15,000 Miles This inspection gives your vehicle a thorough check-up on the brakes, hoses, wheels, exhaust system, steering system, lights and other parts related to the safe function of the vehicle. 
                                            Because this inspection covers so many critical parts, it is one of the most important things you can to prolong your vehicle’s lifespan and keep yourself and your passengers safe.
                                            Put preventative maintenance reminders on your calendar; this is the best way to keep track of what sort of maintenance your car has and hasn’t had done. 
                                            In addition to preventative maintenance options we offer, each of our repairs come with a repair warranty. Schedule your next appointment at Allison Auto Center today.
