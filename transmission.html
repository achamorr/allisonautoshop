                                            What is a transmission? It’s an intricate component of gears and sensors that acts as a bridge between your engine and your wheels. The transmission ensures that the energy provided by the engine travels smoothly to the tires, providing better, safer control for the driver.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            This activity generates a lot of heat, though. Transmission fluid keeps your transmission from getting too hot and sustaining damage. As this fluid is used over time, it becomes less efficient, leaving your transmission more vulnerable to heat damage.

                                            The best way to prevent costly transmission repairs is to keep your transmission fluid fresh. At Allison Auto Center, we can remove your old transmission fluid, perform a complete flush of your transmission system, and install new, premium-quality fluid. We use state-of-the-art technology to monitor this process—and we even see the old, muddied transmission fluid extracted from your car.

                                            As you drive, the transmission helps you shift gears. Most vehicles on the road today use an automatic transmission. You won’t get anywhere in a hurry if your transmission isn’t functioning properly. We’re here to answer some of the commonly asked questions about automatic transmissions.

                                            Many different factors go into determining costs of transmission repair. The major factor is what type of vehicle you drive. The year, make and model of the car, determine how much parts and labor will cost. Another factor is how much damage the transmission has sustained. Your transmission should last a minimum of 100,000 miles by servicing your transmission on a regular basis.

                                            <br>
                                            Fluid is first drained from the pan during an automatic transmission service. A new transmission filter is installed with a new pan gasket once the pan has been removed. Finally, fresh automatic transmission fluid (ATF) is used to refill the vehicle.

                                                3. Is There a Difference Between a Transmission Fluid Change and Flush?

                                            <br>
                                            During a transmission fluid and filter change, it’s only the fluid in the pan that is drained and replaced with new ATF. Four to five quarts of fluid will typically be replaced in this process, while nine to thirteen quarts are replaced during a full transmission fluid flush. The difference in amounts is because the complete flush drains the entire system.

                                            If you don’t do any maintenance on your transmission, it can fail in only 50,000 miles. However, with regular care and maintenance, the lifespan of your transmission can be vastly improved and help you keep repair costs to a minimum. The team at Allison Auto Center is here to share these two easy ways to take care of your transmission.

                                            Our transmission experts recommend getting an automatic transmission fluid exchange every 50,000 miles. Typically factory recommended service is a little bit more than that, but it doesn’t account for harsh driving and weather conditions drivers face on a daily basis. Once you’ve hit 50,000 miles, have your Allison Auto Center location perform a complete fluid flush.

                                            Although it might seem obvious, many people don’t know it’s essential to use the automatic transmission fluid recommended by your vehicle’s manufacturer. This is because different fluids contain different additives that function specifically for certain transmissions. Only the recommended type will ensure your transmission performs correctly. In the event that you’ve had the original transmission changed should you use the recommended fluid for that particular transmission.
